now why does that matter for human health ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .
and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
i started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .
ak : haa haa haaa .
and just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; have you seen this book by michael morpurgo called &apos; war horse &apos; ? &quot;
ak : we were terrified .
here , craig is working the head .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but i believe we should understand the costs .
clay shirky , that great chronicler of everything networked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
there are now , today , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
and i &apos;m hopeful because it &apos;s not only philanthropy that &apos;s reorganizing itself , it &apos;s also whole other portions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because i &apos;ve always felt a mystical connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
we worry that im , texting , facebook are spoiling human intimacy , but stefana broadbent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cultivating deeper relationships , bringing love across barriers like distance and workplace rules .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonomously drifting car .
for instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves .
not a challenging task .
currently , taxpayers spend about 60,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
her family has eight generations in a town called whitesville , west virginia .
yeah .
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
and we all need to be invested in it .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a racetrack in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s .
i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
it always takes time .
true guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
testing in humans is around the corner .
but i &apos;ve come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
he wasn &apos;t extending his legs appropriately .
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
this is in the early 2000s . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , &quot; gee , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
we &apos;ve pledged not to add features , but to bring that price down .
now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space .
and we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of newcomers .
so the fiscal cliff , i was told that that &apos;s too partisan a thing to say , although i can &apos;t remember which party it &apos;s supporting or attacking .
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called unproductive .
now when it comes to taxes , there is more disagreement .
none of these major theories have been completely successful .
the fear is that the world is watching .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something , that really fascinated me , and maybe you can remember it .
it &apos;s actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds .
i &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
that &apos;s not the expression of joy .
in fact , this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face , of which both sides are beautiful .
now that thing , light flickers across it as you move , so it becomes a kinetic object , even though it &apos;s standing still -- managed by how brilliantly that &apos;s done on the reflection .
i &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a millimeter .
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a massively complex one .
it wins or loses at that point .
forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
i don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
it &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
now we don &apos;t think that way .
and at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; thank you plato , thank you shakespeare , thank you jane austen . &quot;
the other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
absolutely . i , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; but isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
so it took me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
it is the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 km long .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole .
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub-zero temperatures .
it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books , and that &apos;s kind of fun .
it was quite popularly attended .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
and we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
exactly what loaning means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
and we get about two or three bands a day signing up .
so 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour , we &apos;re able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the net .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
flowers will arrive by the truckload .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
after they sporulate , they do rot .
when you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris .
all across most land masses .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
this is extremely rare fungus .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the life box -- you &apos;re gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil , you add water , you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores , like of the agarikon mushroom .
i &apos;ve also lived in biosphere 2 .
we needed to know , is life this malleable ?
i was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way .
and the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
and everybody ran up to me .
eritrea , formerly part of ethiopia , is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful , incredibly stark , and i have no understanding of how people eke out a living there .
this is in fact , this beautiful photograph , is in fact over the amazon .
this is actually in a riparian area .
i had to think about how i sew and how i cut , but then also how i pick the right person to come to an operating room .
you set the fracture , you drew the blood , you spun the blood , looked at it under the microscope , you plated the culture , you injected the antiserum .
but it &apos;s pit crews that we need , pit crews for patients .
and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes .
we looked at skyscraper construction , we looked at the aviation world , and we found that they have technology , they have training , and then they have one other thing : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s been slow to spread .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
so it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs , and so they &apos;ve been able to cover those losses .
you know , they pick up their hives ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
however , honeybees are a minority .
if there &apos;s a cave in new york that had 15,000 bats in it , and there are 1,000 left . that &apos;s like san francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years .
now , not all of us have meadows , or lawns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a meadow in a pot .
and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family-in-law .
and to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- i thought , well let &apos;s go back in 2005 , and i won again .
this is very promising .
why ?
the blue whale , the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong , completely wrong .
so during the night , they curl the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j.d. hooker , or at that time , president of the royal society , so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
until now , the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
and then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
so i got inspired by that .
so again , this is 2005 .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
it &apos;s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon , watching a football game in a stadium .
it &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
this is ted .
and that is the spell that i want to break .
now , children below the age of consent are a special case .
they &apos;re a sort of ectosymbiont .
the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , unbelievably brilliant .
that is what we have done on this planet .
the ant isn &apos;t alone .
you &apos;ve just heard the man .
i really appreciated that .
now , i just do not believe that .
now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical .
that &apos;s the devil speaking . &quot;
so you are , in fact , a chord -- each of you an individual chord .
men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
the third problem with headphones is this : deafness -- noise-induced hearing disorder .
sound healing is a wonderful modality .
i &apos;m leaving you with a little more birdsong , which is very good for you .
and he &apos;s like , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look what it has in the middle of it .
you guys are facing that way , so i &apos;ll hook it to this one .
and we actually sent this guy materials .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own passions , and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens .
and yet black holes may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they bang on space-time like a drum .
now our sun will not collapse to a black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
and we can predict what the sound will be .
there &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
it gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave paintings .
trees epitomize stasis .
that , i think , is movement .
we &apos;re being critical of the west , the perception of the west about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
but instead , i found a country that was totally ideological and that i didn &apos;t recognize anymore .
that iran was once a secular society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government , by the british government .
i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice is giving me my voice .
on that self , it should be centered -- a bigness , a wholeness .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
maybe the swami is right .
you learn swimming by swimming . you learn cycling by cycling .
this animal &apos;s fossils are only found in this area of south america -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of africa .
they can just watch those videos . if they &apos;re bored , they can go ahead .
but i was excited , so i kept going .
and the khan academy videos are there .
this is shifting and reflecting functions .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
a lot of the effort in humanizing the classroom is focused on student-to-teacher ratios .
and the collaboration you &apos;re doing with los altos , how did that come about ?
is this ready for prime time ?
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
but it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
so on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , &quot; and who are these handsome young men with you ? &quot;
and then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations .
there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
&quot; kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
they occasionally interest me , and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
edith widder : so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
for example , this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud .
this looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
there &apos;s something small there that responds .
it &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
one way around this is to draw pictures .
if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands , you see these things that look like teeth .
it &apos;s packaged up and bundled up .
one is bundled up into one sausage .
so again , this is all derived accurately from the science .
keep your eyes lifted and your head turning .
the ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition .
when the subject is still very thinly populated , you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority .
i &apos;m here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done .
not created by the printing press , but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy .
the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
toyota , instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace , treats them as a network and trains them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , it &apos;s all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing -- cold , challenging circumstances .
and to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people legos , and we asked them to build with legos .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they were building it , we took apart the one that they just finished .
there was a very nice correlation between love of lego and the amount of legos people built .
and i think the ceo basically did not understand the importance of meaning .
but i should point out , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people could have cheated .
people did not want them .
and we had two types of people .
now think about kids .
and i think that in the industrial revolution , adam smith was more correct than karl marx , but the reality is that we &apos;ve switched and now we &apos;re in the knowledge economy .
and this is very normal now , of modern day conflict , because they &apos;re easy to bring into wars .
and my mother &apos;s vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible , she &apos;d given all the boys and girls new vietnamese names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
they did not want to do this , it just happened -- they lost control .
and 70 percent regained their lives .
so i believe this kept me running .
that &apos;s the european average for new cars .
top right , bahrain has the same energy consumption per person , roughly , as canada , over 300 light bulbs per person , but their population density is a factor of 300 times greater , 1,000 people per square kilometer .
if you really want to get a lot from solar panels , you need to adopt the traditional bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof and coat the countryside with solar panels too .
and a third option is nuclear power .
i &apos;ve tried it . it works . some people call it a lifestyle change .
since i was a boy , in my early childhood , i always wanted to be a musician , and , thank god , i made it .
he is a boy from a parish in caracas who passionately attended to his double bass lessons at the san agustin &apos;s junior orchestra .
that encourages them to embrace new dreams , new goals , and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer .
it &apos;s surreptitious technology that &apos;s helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time .
how do you put simple disruptive technologies , and the first of five phrases that i &apos;m going to talk about in this talk ?
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
the first word that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
many people in this generation won &apos;t press the button , even if they have an alert call system , because they don &apos;t want to bother anybody , even though they &apos;ve been paying 30 dollars a month .
the color represents different rooms they are in the house .
i &apos;m going to be showing some of the cybercriminals &apos; latest and nastiest creations .
if you want your rivals to go offline , well , they will .
now how do you get a usb key to run in a business ?
so let &apos;s imagine that our attacker , called evil hacker just for comedy value , inserts something a little nasty .
there are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded .
now you &apos;re probably wondering what happened to these guys .
seven hundred and sixty-one of you i could identify a hotel you &apos;d been to recently , absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe .
thank you .
the adults can recognize the juveniles ; the juveniles can recognize the adults .
and they &apos;re in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone .
now we all know that bones are fossilized , and so if you dump it into acid , there shouldn &apos;t be anything left .
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
transgenesis is really cool too .
a friend of mine , a colleague of mine , dr. hans larsson at mcgill university , is actually looking at atavisms .
and people always say , &quot; why do that ?
eventually , i set about writing my book , really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale . what this shows is a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world .
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
this farmer , for example , has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach , not one leaf of which he harvested , potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect , all going for pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , cut the slice off , stuck it in a vase of water , it was all right for another two weeks after this .
and when you use these things you don &apos;t have to go like that .
i &apos;ll go through a little of them . bolotnitsa .
left to the thymiamata .
we &apos;ve got to change this stuff up fast .
there is obviously einstein , niels bohr , de fermat &apos;s last theorem , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james coburn or richard harris .
and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other .
what a handsome cat .
before the horse .
&quot; ten milligram , 20 milligram . &quot;
so , i said if i &apos;m going to put a circle , see what kind of patterns i get , boom , the red system .
you gotta be accurate ! there &apos;s measurement involved , increments .
there were only two other dannys on the internet then .
i &apos;ll come back to that later .
i mean , everything off , it &apos;s like the service call you get from the cable company , except for the whole world .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
for example , if we &apos;d had tedxparis 350 years ago , we would have talked about the military innovation of the day -- the massive vauban-style fortifications -- and we could have predicted a period of stability in the world or in europe .
in this context , when you don &apos;t know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack , and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking , then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict .
it &apos;s just a big blue surface .
so if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that &apos;s what a dinosaur looks like .
he can &apos;t spin a web anytime ; he &apos;s got to pull his pants down first .
he never seems to settle on any particular girl .
so what i did was i made an adventure strip .
you really don &apos;t have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because , if you start with a talking shark , readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door .
so you get this sense of urgency , like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible .
my job description was deliciously vague : wilderness assessment and public relations .
what that means is , i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call &quot; mathemagics . &quot;
audience : 25 .
audience : 987 .
audience : seven . seven .
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
audience : november . november what ?
of course , i could just make up an answer and you wouldn &apos;t know , so i come prepared for that .
ok , oh , ok -- you have a 10-digit calculator , sir , as well ?
let me explain what that is .
i would love to talk about my astronomy , but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
no , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
just two weeks ago i made -- you know , i &apos;ve been making small , medium and big klein bottles for the trade .
mentoring me . he &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
i take lunch hour .
right ? this is simple physics .
if you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot;
so you &apos;d think , with all this extra space , we &apos;d have plenty of room for all our stuff .
it &apos;s time for me to let it go .
would that give me a little more freedom ?
north of churchill , manitoba , in october and november , there &apos;s no ice on hudson bay .
and it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before i really began to recognize that i didn &apos;t really have a full understanding of it .
frank wilson had written a book called &quot; the hand . &quot;
so what does play do for the brain ?
this took a long time -- i had to get homer down and put him through the fmri and the spect and multiple eegs , but as a couch potato , his brain has shrunk .
your own personal play history is unique , and often is not something we think about particularly .
characterized by a feeling of energized focus , full involvement and success in the process of the activity .
how do you prevent either the media &apos;s interpretation of your work or the scientific community &apos;s interpretation of the implications of your work , kind of like the mozart metaphor , where , &quot; oh , mris show that play enhances your intelligence .
the difference between our nachos and the other guy &apos;s nachos , is that this is actually a dessert .
br : and then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear , we really have something that looks , tastes and behaves like the real thing .
and in paris , the ipcc released its study confirming man &apos;s impact on global warming .
alisa miller : the news about the news
and it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they &apos;re just going about their everyday business .
and in this project we &apos;ve developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
and no matter where i am , what &apos;s really going on here is that it &apos;s an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes .
and inside it &apos;s got an 800-pound robot arm that i borrowed , from a friend .
at this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with hiv .
deep in a remote region of cameroon , two hunters stalk their prey .
but they &apos;re also going to ask you probably a different question .
when we would get to these rural villages , though , what we found out is that no one had television , so they wouldn &apos;t recognize his face .
needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct .
you say what you &apos;re doing in 140 characters or less , and people who are interested in you get those updates .
we built an application-programming interface , which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .
&quot; evan williams , give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at ted . &quot;
because all i had read were books in which characters were foreign , i had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which i could not personally identify .
all i had heard about them was how poor they were , so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor .
and so i began to realize that my american roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story , as had a professor , who once told me that my novel was not &quot; authentically african . &quot;
start the story with the arrows of the native americans , and not with the arrival of the british , and you have an entirely different story .
i &apos;ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
i teach writing workshops in lagos every summer , and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are eager to write , to tell stories .
in a recent experiment , a group of adults had their brains scanned in an mri machine as they were listening to experts speak .
why was it that , when i had an operation , &quot; beware , ms. hertz , of hyperpyrexia , &quot; when he could have just as easily said , &quot; watch out for a high fever . &quot;
my dad has alzheimer &apos;s disease .
and reading is just about impossible .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
so we &apos;re bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
as a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we &apos;re in in the u.s.
when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish .
and if you really have a long day you can switch , and keep on driving around the island .
that &apos;s all the u.s. usage today .
the indians don &apos;t even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
let &apos;s not do it immediately . maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves .
the arguments of so-called id theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again , since darwin down to the present day .
darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity .
now , the next one , &quot; the president of the royal society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction &quot; -- -- &quot; ... that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
she clearly feels in a beleaguered minority , but actually , how do american atheists stack up numerically ?
i &apos;ve not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields , such history or philosophy , but i &apos;d be surprised if they were different .
darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia , but that ordinary people were not , quote , &quot; ripe for it . &quot;
when atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein use the word &quot; god , &quot; they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep , mysterious part of physics which we don &apos;t yet understand .
and it cost about 500 dollars to start it , which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today .
it used to be wireless was one person owned the license , they transmitted in an area , and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property .
just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning , or , in places that are more involved , like wikipedia , gives me a certain set of social relations .
there are no slides , so you &apos;ll just have to be content with me .
a study by the economic commission for africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 african countries .
the state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it &apos;s inefficient and incompetent .
but what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where , even if oil prices were high , we would grow very fast .
we are doing the same with the insurance sector .
otherwise , i would have liked you to have seen this .
he called these , &quot; massively fatal discontinuities , &quot; meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we haven &apos;t had to know exactly how a vaccine worked .
the principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they &apos;re always changing .
these drugs aren &apos;t cures , but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence at least for those who can access them .
but , you know , the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
it was a slow , cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
and , aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example , the e. coli method i just talked about -- look at the time saved : this would be lives saved .
so , the challenge is full speed ahead .
the question is , why ?
you think the a.u. will put together a conference like this ?
there are certain things that we need to recognize .
now , the previous speaker before me , idris mohammed , indicated that we &apos;ve had abysmal leadership in africa .
by raking it off the backs of their suffering people .
traditionally , africans hate governments . they hate tyranny .
they decide what to do .
he &apos;s getting no assistance from the government , and he &apos;s building a second , bigger boat .
it meant something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they &apos;re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives .
and the man said , &quot; he &apos;s come down a long way , hasn &apos;t he ? &quot;
now , i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- i &apos;m kidding -- but these are the recapitulation slides , and then i &apos;m going to go into new material about what you can do .
and by the time the movie comes out in may , this will be updated to 2.0 and we will have click-through purchases of offsets .
again , the republicans here , this shouldn &apos;t be partisan .
one of the things that really impresses me about the people in the gulf : they are really , really aquatic people .
and there &apos;s basically nobody there anymore , a few people trying to keep using it .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
these tuna swim the entire ocean .
even when the japanese bombed pearl harbor , at least they shot back .
as far as cleaning them , i don &apos;t mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds .
okay , people who say they &apos;re conservative , if they really wanted to be really conservative and really patriotic , they would tell these corporations to go to hell .
it &apos;s a matter of right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
all right : &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes &quot; -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to chant it because it &apos;s true ; i just want you to remember it .
they contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter .
and that &apos;s just a mouse brain -- it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human brain .
well , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , and they can lose old ones .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
and if you appreciate that number , you can easily see there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain .
eventually , these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains .
he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company , the directors bureau .
so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you .
ks : no , not yet .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
ks : now the way it works : there &apos;s a matrix of color dyes .
ridiculous , right ?
so several months ago , a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he was still going like this .
i mean , his farm is incredible .
but he found this wild plant called the lupin bush .
and then they circle around .
i finally got to taste it before i left .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what the hell does that mean ?
supposedly , anyway . i believe that one .
farmers that rely on nature for solutions , for answers , rather than imposing solutions on nature .
and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity , each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air .
our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles .
don &apos;t worry about dropping it , it &apos;s tougher than titanium .
the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third .
already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill .
and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same , about six trillion dollars at present value -- whether we buy more of what we &apos;ve got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal , or renewables that are more or less centralized .
so focusing on outcomes , not motives , can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to america &apos;s energy challenge .
only i later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
so this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
two years ago , on april 8th , 2010 , i called my father .
i don &apos;t try to design the toothbrush .
we must remember , and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old , that life appears four billion years ago , around -- four billion point two ?
something like that . i am not sure of that .
there is some danger , there is some trap . one trap : the vertical .
we have time to think , we have time to i don &apos;t know what , speak about art and things like that .
you go to the future back , back , back , back , like that .
they all come from homes where there is , for the most part , just one person in the home , usually the mother or the grandmother , and that &apos;s it , and they come here for their education and for their structure .
we teach them how to go right face , left face , so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions .
let &apos;s get it all online . &quot;
it &apos;s predictable .
they said , &quot; it &apos;s good enough for government work .
and then you can support us . that &apos;s the role of you guys . &quot;
but i gotta have my hot dog .
they can listen and join the conversation .
take the travel service nextpedition .
if you think of the concept of wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content , and at the end of the day you &apos;ve built the largest encyclopedia in the world .
there are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
a page was created .
there was no leader .
extremism became tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what &apos;s going on up there is nothing short of rocket science .
we can discriminate the sounds of our own language , but not those of foreign languages .
and we tested this by exposing american babies who &apos;d never heard a second language to mandarin for the first time during the critical period .
it looks like a hair dryer from mars .
if you look at science on one hand , science is a very rational approach to its surroundings , whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings .
now i &apos;ve got a live demonstration over here to show this to you .
let me demonstrate this over here .
a line that the dalai lama once said , he said , &quot; love and compassion are necessities .
the rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned .
it is there within every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote on compassion ?
the wound is just filled with maggots .
suppose you like to square numbers , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t ?
we &apos;ll start with a one-by-one square and next to that put another one-by-one square .
then there was aron kader , who was the palestinian-american .
i said , &quot; he passed away a long time ago .
&quot; i didn &apos;t get the memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i &apos;m like , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
so i went down to the lobby , and i saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : when asked about deception , he said this : magic is the only honest profession .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life .
at the same time , while i was interviewing the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics .
in fact , i think many people thought that i was a bit crazy .
but above all , they started to do serious business with the world of crime .
these were money taken out in suitcases or in containers , in cash of course .
nobody wants the u.s. monetary authority to check their relationship , to monitor their relationship with their clientele .
now , some of you might be thinking , &quot; hold on a minute . she doesn &apos;t look very much like an ocean rower .
sure , i had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone , but what i &apos;d sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is , by definition , extremely uncomfortable .
and i really learned then that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really , really big .
but it was not without misadventure .
it &apos;s that little green sliver on the horizon , which makes them very nervous about rising oceans .
we can start making better , wiser , more sustainable decisions .
roz savage : why i &apos;m rowing across the pacific
there &apos;s the world trade center site , on the front cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
it doesn &apos;t see any excess cost . it doesn &apos;t spend any extra time .
they were able to create that .
and finally , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about making you feel good in places that you wouldn &apos;t have felt good before .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i wondered , what made my dreams so easy to dismiss ?
turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , i said , &quot; yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and i gave him all the wrong answers that i &apos;d written down the night before .
we both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs .
maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show-and-tell , but never told , because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it ?
that &apos;s french science .
all right , here we go .
if you look at that truck there , it is the largest truck of its kind of the planet .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it is the largest and fastest-growing single source of carbon in canada , and it is also a reason why canada is now number three in terms of producing carbon per person .
and as a parent , i just can &apos;t imagine what that does to your soul .
in doing so , we &apos;ll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink and replacing it with the most high greenhouse gas emission oil in the future .
the central motif of bharti &apos;s practice is the ready-made store-bought bindi that untold millions of indian women apply to their foreheads , every day , in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage .
